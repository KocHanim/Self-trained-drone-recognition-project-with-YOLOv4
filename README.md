# YOLOv4: Object Detection and Classification 


You Only Look Once, or YOLO for short, represents a breakthrough technology in object detection and classification. YOLOv4 is an extremely impressive masterpiece in this field. 
YOLOv4 is a groundbreaking technological achievement in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision, performing object detection and classification with extraordinary speed and accuracy.

The YOLO algorithm first divides the image into square (5x5, 13x13) grids. Each grid is recognised separately and it is decided whether there is an object in it or not. 
If there is an object in the grid, it is checked whether the centre point of the object is within the grid and the grid with the centre point is determined.

# Why YOLOv4?

1. Speed and Real-Time Processing
2. High Accuracy
3. Multi-Classroom Support
4. Wide Application Area

# Model Training

YOLOv4 model training is prepared via Google Colab: Google Colab offers a free and accessible platform for model training. 
It allows you to launch and share your deep learning projects without requiring more processing power. 
With features such as free GPU and TPU usage, user-friendly interface and Google Drive integration, Colab makes model training easier and faster.
 The training, which takes about 4 hours, is prepared with 1000 photos of data (1000 photos is too few for a healthy model training).
"https://www.makesense.ai/" and "https://www.kaggle.com/" were used for the labelling of the photos used in the model training and for the sources. 
In addition, "https://roboflow.com/" is my recommendation for easier labelling. The trained model has 1 class, the cfg file has been updated accordingly.
The model has successfully passed the train and test phases. It was tested with a sample YOLOv4 code in Spyder Integrated development environment.
